In Hindu tradition, the *Chiranjivis* are beings who are blessed with immortality or an exceptionally long life, destined to live until the end of the current Kali Yuga. The seven *Chiranjivis* are:

- **Vyasa**: Also known as Vedavyasa, he is the sage who compiled the Vedas and wrote the Mahabharata. Vyasa is considered immortal, living to spread knowledge and wisdom through the ages.
- **Mahabali (Bali)**: The righteous Asura king who was granted immortality by Lord Vishnu. After his defeat by Vamana, the dwarf incarnation of Vishnu, he was given the boon to live in Patala (the netherworld) and is believed to return as a great king in the future.
- **Hanuman**: The monkey god, a devotee of Lord Rama, known for his immense strength, devotion, and wisdom. Hanuman is immortal and is believed to continue living on earth, serving and protecting the righteous.
- **Vibhishana**: The younger brother of Ravana, who defected to Lord Ramaâ€™s side during the battle of Lanka. Due to his righteousness and support for Dharma, he was granted immortality and made the king of Lanka.
- **Ashwatthama**: The son of Dronacharya, Ashwatthama was cursed by Lord Krishna to live eternally as a result of his heinous actions during the Kurukshetra war. His immortality is seen more as a curse than a blessing, as he is destined to wander the earth in suffering.
- **Kripacharya**: The royal preceptor of the Kauravas and Pandavas, Kripacharya fought in the Mahabharata war. He was blessed with immortality for his devotion and knowledge of the scriptures.
- **Parashurama**: The sixth avatar of Vishnu, Parashurama is a warrior sage who wielded an axe and is known for destroying the Kshatriya class 21 times. He is immortal and is believed to be living in penance, waiting for the arrival of the next Vishnu avatar, Kalki.

These seven *Chiranjivis* are believed to play significant roles in preserving righteousness and are revered across various texts and traditions within Hinduism.
